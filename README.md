# Bike Service Pricing Panel Webpage

## About the Project

Utilized Flexbox to create a static HTML/CSS page. Created a custom navigation bar using Flexbox as well. The page contains three different pricing panels for a bike company. When the user is viewing the page on a mobile device it will be in a column format. The page is also responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
